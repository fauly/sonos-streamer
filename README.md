# Sonos-Streamer
This app takes audio input from computer default speaker and creates a streaming audio file that can easily be accessed by most smart speakers.

## The problem
My required application was being able to easily stream to a sonos S1 system with minimal control required, so my computers ip address is the url for a radio station on TuneIn via the Sonos App.

## The aim
The aim was ideally a one file build by compiling in ffmpeg etc. and using native audio libraries.

## The result
An easy way to resolve streaming any device audio to speakers though the latency is large and perhaps i'll look into reducing this later.

Download and use it easily as an exe or app.
